# Dual-N-Back
This is a simple game I designed in my 2nd year using C++ OOP

## Implementation
In this project, the visual aspect of the Dual-N-Back game is implemented. The user needs to remember the positions of the object in the 3x3 grid for each round and enter whether it is the same or different from N rounds ago. The program will calculate how many times the user is correct and display the final result at the end.

## New feature 
The Dual-N-Back game is simple and doesn’t require much effort or energy to play. However, the lack of color and imagery can make it bland and boring for many users. Therefore, we decided to not only test the user’s memory but to also tickle their imagination in the game. 
Images  created using ASCII characters have been added to the program to create a sense of story. At the start of the game, the user is shown to be in  a village and is told that he must face the coming challenges to escape.

As the game goes on,  the points are calculated and at the end of the game either of two images are shown to the user: a castle or a windmill.
The castle symbolizes victory and completion. Therefore, it is shown only when the user is able  to answer the challenges correctly every round.

The windmill on the other hand, symbolizes hopeless wandering.

If the user is unable to answer all the  questions correctly, he is unable to reach the castle and therefore finds himself wandering around in an open field.
 
The user is then encouraged to try the game again. It is human nature to dislike losing. Therefore, when the user knows they haven’t arrived at the correct destination and are visually aware of their loss, they will naturally want to replay the game.

Before, the user’s only motivation to play was to test his memory. Now, there is an additional goal of completing the journey successfully in order to satisfy the user's imagination.
